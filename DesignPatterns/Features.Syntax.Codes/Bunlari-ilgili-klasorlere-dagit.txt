Readonly members
You can apply the readonly modifier to members of a struct. It indicates that the member doesn't modify state. It's more granular than applying the readonly modifier to a struct declaration. Consider the following mutable struct:

C#

Copy
public struct Point
{
    public double X { get; set; }
    public double Y { get; set; }
    public double Distance => Math.Sqrt(X * X + Y * Y);

    public override string ToString() =>
        $"({X}, {Y}) is {Distance} from the origin";
}

public readonly override string ToString() =>
    $"({X}, {Y}) is {Distance} from the origin";
